# üåô Tool for calculating the best time to wake up or fall asleep
[Demo](https://romenkova.github.io/sleep/)

**‚ùì Why?**

One sleep cycle lasts **90 minutes** on average, which means that if the whole amount of sleep is divisible by 1.5 hours, waking up will be easier. 

A healthy person needs 5-6 such cycles: **7.5** or **9 hours** of sleep, but even if it's not possible 3 hours of sleep (2 cycles) feels more full then 4 hours.
